Important: i added some remarks (search for the word Remark)

My basis was : https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/FIBR/FiBo.pdf
What did I show?


Firstly, the main goal was
  · a functor Sp : fibration B ⥤ splitFibration B
  · equipped with an equivalence of fibrations E: Sp P ⥤c P, which means a cartesian functor which has a pseudo cartesian inverse (i.e. an equivalence in the bicategory of fibrations)
    (because then, which i tried to formalize, it reflects cartesian morphisms,
    which is almost as good as having a cartesian quasi-inverse functor P ⥤c Sp P)

The functor Sp factors as
  psh ≫ Grothendieck : fibration B ⥤ PShCat B ⥤ splitFibration B
  where the first map is P ↦ Fib(fundamentalfibration · , P)
  so we have to pull back the yoneda embedding at P along a functor
    fundamentalFibration : B ⥤ fibration B
Sorries:
-I didnt implemented the whole bicategory structure of fibrations although it should not be difficult.
-There should only be relevant sorries in SplitFibrationViaGrothendieck,
  I underestimated the complexity of showing that the Grothendieck construction associated to a presheaf of categories is a split fibration.
  Furthermore there are some lemmas associated to this construction that are not completely proven
-Sidenote:
  Secondly, In the file PresheavesOfCategories, I constructed a functor

  splitfibration B ⥤ PShCat B , which is of independent interest.
  So i constructed functors in both directions PShCat B ⥤ splitFibration.
  Originally i wanted to show, that this is a strong equivalence of 2-categories whose inverse is given by the grothendieck construction
  (which i also implemented)
  Here some things are missing
